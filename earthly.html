							<p>Motivated by the pressing issue of climate change, we embarked on a 
								project aimed at addressing the individual's role in combating global 
								warming: their carbon footprint. Our inspiration led us to create a website that 
								empowers people to assess and compare their carbon footprint, thereby 
								encouraging them to make lifestyle changes for a more sustainable impact. 
								The website allows users to upload their travel data, unveiling the 
								carbon implications of their choices, whether it's opting for public 
								transportation, cycling, or walking. Users can also gauge their carbon 
								footprint against local peers, engaging in challenges to keep it below 
								specific levels. Additionally, there's an informative section explaining 
								the broader impact of carbon footprints on global warming, along with suggestions 
								for reducing them. We built this platform primarily using React and JavaScript 
								for the front-end, with Supabase and PostgreSQL supporting the back-end. 
								While we encountered challenges, including mastering row-level security and managing 
								time constraints, we were able win the "Best Hack for Environmental Sustainability" award
								out of 91 projects by 500 participants over 24 schools. Looking ahead, we plan to expand 
								Earthly into a mobile app and integrate it with smart devices for automated data tracking. 
								Our vision extends beyond transportation to encompass other environmentally impactful activities, 
								such as energy consumption and temperature control. You can visit the site 
								<a href="https://earthly.zavaar.net">here</a> and see the code <a href="https://github.com/mlyoung25/earthly">
